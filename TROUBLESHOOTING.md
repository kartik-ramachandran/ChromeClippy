- âœ… background.js
- âœ… clippy.css
- âœ… popup.html
- âœ… popup.js

## Alternative Loading Method:

If the above doesn't work, try this method:

1. **Pack the extension**:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Load as Developer Extension**:
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`

   - If it doesn't appear, check the console for errors

## Common Issues:

### CSP Errors
If you see Content Security Policy errors:
- The website is blocking the extension
- Try on a different website
- Gmail, Facebook, and some sites have strict CSP

### Extension Not Loading
- Make sure you're selecting the `dist` folder, not the root folder
- Check that all files were built successfully
- Look for any build errors in the terminal

### Chrome Version
- Make sure you're using Chrome 121+ for Built-in AI features
- Check `chrome://version/`
